##' This function performs aggregation on the flag
##'
##' The aggregation is based on the weight of the flag as designated
##' by the table. Official sources has high weight while data from
##' unreliable sources has low weight.
##'
##' @param ... Vectors of Flags, see detail
##' @param flagTable The table which maps the relationship between the
##' flag and its information weight.
##'
##' @details The arguement for flag is the same to the function
##' sum. Multiple instances of the flag can be pass in to the function
##' to be aggregated.
